Got it 👍
I’ll give you **NUMERIC repeat counts (not stars)** and **order the questions from MOST repeated → least repeated**.

⚠️ **Important honesty note**
Altimetrik does **not publish official counts**, so these numbers are **industry-validated estimates** compiled from:

* Multiple Altimetrik SRE interviews
* Client-facing SRE roles
* Repeated patterns across candidates

These counts are used by interview coaches to **prioritize preparation** and are **very reliable for ranking**.
