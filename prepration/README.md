1) What is the role of an SRE in a product engineering company?

```
An SRE ensures that the product is reliable, scalable, and always available for users.
They automate operations, monitor systems, handle production issues, and work closely with developers
so new features can be released safely without impacting reliability
```
2) How is SRE different from DevOps in real projects?
```
DevOps is about culture and automation, while SRE is about applying engineering to keep systems reliable and scalable.
```
3) How do you implement SLOs for customer-facing applications?
```
First, I identify what users care about, like availability and latency.
Second, I set clear SLO targets, for example 99.9% responses under 300ms.
Third, I monitor and alert on SLOs using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
Fourth, I use error budgets to control risk and slow releases if needed.
Finally, I review incidents and improve based on user impact.

4) What is an error budget and how do you use it practically?
```
```
5) How do you measure reliability in production?
```
```
6) How do you reduce operational toil?
```
```
7) When do you say NO to a release?
```
```
8) How do you bring reliability culture to dev teams?
```
