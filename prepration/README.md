How do you implement SLOs for customer-facing applications?
```
First, I identify what users care about, like availability and latency.
Second, I set clear SLO targets, for example 99.9% responses under 300ms.
Third, I monitor and alert on SLOs using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
Fourth, I use error budgets to control risk and slow releases if needed.
Finally, I review incidents and improve based on user impact.
